# C# Live Project

## Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at The Tech Academy, I worked with my peers developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C# called TheatreCMS. 
During this two week sprint we utilized version control and held daily stand ups and worked as a team using Azure DevOps. This project is the interactive 
website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. It's meant to be a content management service for users who are not technically 
savvy and want to easily manage what displays in their website. It's also meant to help manage login capability for subscribers, and maintain a wiki of past performances and performers.

I was tasked with creating a static method that can be used to limit the number of characters that are displayed using ellipses. 
This method takes in a string and an integer.

I created a model in the Blog Area called Blog Author. This model represents a Blog Writer/Author for the Theatre.

I was also tasked with creating the Edit and Create pages for the Blog Author. The Name field should be a text field and the Bio field should be a text area
with a minimum width of about 100px. The Joined and Left field should allow the user to select the date and time in the same field. The Joined field should be required and the Left field 
should be optional.

</p>  

The Details and Delete page for a Blog Author should look like a card with buttons at the top of the card for 
Author Details, Blog Posts, Contact, and Twitter. Social media icons on the top right of the page were added using Font Awesome icons and when 
you click on them they direct you to that website.

</p>

Clicking on Blog Posts hides all of the Author's details and shows the blog post section.

</p>

I had to create a partial view that houses the HTML and Razor that reperesents a Blog Author. I had to render those partial
views for each Blog Author in the database.
